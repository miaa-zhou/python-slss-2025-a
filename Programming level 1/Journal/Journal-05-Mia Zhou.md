## Designing a Function

> In your `work-functions.py` file, create a function that calculates the average of three numbers. Here are the requirements in detail:
>
> * call it `average`
> * it should accept three parameters: `num_one`, `num_two`, and `num_three`
> * it should calculate the average value of the three numbers:
> 	* recall that to calculate the average, you add the values then divide by the number of values you have
> * return the result
>
>  *Optional*: write another version that accepts a list and returns the average of all things inside the list

> Test your function and copy and paste your code in the block below.

```python
def average(num_one: float, num_two: float, num_three: float) -> float:
    """Return the average"""
    # add all numbers together
    sum = num_one + num_two + num_three

    average = sum / 3

    return average


result = average(62, 61, 60)
print(result)

result = average(97, 95, 95)
print(result)


```

## Using your function

> Use the function that you created above to calculate your average WPM and accuracy. What is your average over your three results?

wpm:  61.0
accuracy: 95.67
