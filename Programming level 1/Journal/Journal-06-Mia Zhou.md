I don't really know, but I think trying to lock in and understand what I'm doing is hard. 

## Loops

> Consider the code below.
> How many times does this iterate?

```python
for _ in range(5):
	# some code in here
```

5 times I think... 

> Consider this code, now.
> How many times do you think this iterates?

```python
for _ in range(5):
	for _ in range(5):
		# some code in here
```

I think it iterates 25 times.
