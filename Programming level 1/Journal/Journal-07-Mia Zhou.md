## Recursion

***Please use your brain for these, no LLMs. I'm not looking for right answers, just your answers.***

- make sure the function works already
- base case

This is a recursive definition because recursive solves the problems like how the recursive functions repeats to solve a problem. 

> Consider the function below. How many times will it call itself not including the initial function call?
> (It's poorly documented on purpose.)

```python
def some_recursive_function(int):
	if num > 1:
		return num + some_recursive_function(num-1)
	else:
		return 0

result = some_recursive_function(10)
```
