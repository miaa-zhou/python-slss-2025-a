> What does increment mean? (You can use an LLM if you wish to find the answer to this. If you did, just know that your query used around 0.3 Wh.)

increment means to increase the variable's value by 1.

> What is the post-fix increment operator for the C computing language? (Again, you can use an LLM.)

It is the original value of x that's used first then the x variable is incremented. It adds 1 to the x variable but it ony does that after the exression is like evaluated.

int x = 5;
int y = x++;

x == 6
y == 5

> Why do you think C++ is called that??

I think it's called that because it's a easier way to symbolize or to show increment C by 1.
