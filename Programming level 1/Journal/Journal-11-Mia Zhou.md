## Linear Search

> Hidden in one house is a treasure. Using human language, describe how you would use linear search to find the treasure. To help, try making a numbered, step-by-step procedure.

1. make a list of where you can look like bedroom or bathrrom, etc
2. start with the first place on your list and look everywhere in that place
3. if you find the treasure then you're done but if you don't move on to the next place on the list
4. look everywhere in the next place, and keep looking inplaces on your list until you find the treasure.
