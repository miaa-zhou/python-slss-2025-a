## Classes and Objects

> Imagine we're describing a tree. What properties would you use to describe a tree? (This is similar to the exercise that we did in class yesterday, finding ways to use properties to describe Pokemon.) You can use bullet points.

- what color the leaves are
- what type of tree it is (if you know the type)
- how tall or short it is, like if it's very tall or short
- if it has leaves or it only has bracnhes
- do we see the tree often or is it rare

## Holidays

> What are your plans for the winter holidays?

I want to go snowboarding, but i'm not sure what plans I have for the break.
