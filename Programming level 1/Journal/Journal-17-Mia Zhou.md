> What are some skills you've developed in Programming that you can take with you in the future?

I learned lots of problem solving skills that I can carry with me and use it in the future.  Thnis class helped me further develop my ability to turn big challenges into smaller steps, making it easier for me to solve. 

> Thank about students taking this class in the future. What advice would you give to them about the class?

I would tell them this is a fun class, and don't worry if you feel lost in the beginning if you've never programmed before because it can get confusing at times. 


## But it's just the beginning...

> What do you have next semester?

- Metal works
- Social justice
- Marketing 
> Will you say hi in the hallways to me after this class? (I won't take offense if you don't.)

YES

> Have a great semester 2. Any words you want to leave me?

also have a great second semester 😁 and also my typing at the end compared to the start probably is worse because I got my nails done and I can't really type as good. LOL
