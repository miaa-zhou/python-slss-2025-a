##`in` keyword --> `Str`

If you want to see if a string contains some characters or if it contains a **substring** we can use te `in` keyword. 

```python
# Ask the costumer if they want fries
frues_reply = input ("Dou you want fries?")
# "yes!"
# "Yes!"

if "yes" in fries-reply.lower:
	print("Here are your fries.")
else: 
	print("OK, you will not have fries.")

```
